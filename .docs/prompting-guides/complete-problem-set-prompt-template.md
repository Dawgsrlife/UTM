## Iterative Improvement Strategy

### The Multi-Phase Audit Approach

**Don't expect perfection on first pass.** Use iterative refinement:

#### Phase 1: Initial Complete Draft

1. Run the full prompt with all materials
2. Get complete solutions for all questions
3. Don't fix issues yet—let AI finish everything first

#### Phase 2: Focused Technical Audits

For each question individually:

```text
Audit Q[X] against the lecture notes from Week [Y-Z]. Specifically check:
1. Does the proof technique match what's taught in lectures?
2. Are we using the correct terminology from the course?
3. Are all mathematical steps justified per course standards?
4. Fix any technical errors found.
```

**Why individual audits?** Each question requires deep focus. Catching 5 critical errors across 5 questions (one per question) is typical and expected.

#### Phase 3: Comprehensive Lecture Alignment

After individual fixes:

```text
Do a comprehensive audit ensuring all work is correct and completed according to
the involved lecture notes from Week [X] to Week [Y].
```

This catches methodological inconsistencies across questions.

#### Phase 4: Final Polish

Request specific improvements:

```text
- Add type contracts to all pseudocode method signatures
- Fix any formatting issues (e.g., formulas exceeding margins)
- Ensure consistent notation throughout
```

#### Phase 5: Pre-Submission Verification

```text
Do a final check for:
1. Compilation (no errors)
2. All marks present and correct
3. No TODO/FIXME markers
4. No AI thinking markers
5. Professional presentation
```

### Critical Success Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Catch AI Thinking Immediately

**Always do a final read-through yourself.** Look for:

- "Wait—" or "Hmm," (thinking out loud)
- "The key insight" (meta-commentary)
- "Interestingly," "It turns out" (AI observations)
- "Let me think" or "Actually," (self-correction)

**When found, request specific fix:**

```text
URGENT: Remove the AI thinking marker "[exact phrase]" from Q[X].
Rewrite with natural undergraduate analysis using concrete steps instead of meta-commentary.
```

#### Pattern 2: Verify Reduction Directions

For NP-completeness proofs, **always verify:**

```text
In Q[X], confirm the reduction direction is correct.
We need [KNOWN NP-COMPLETE] ≤_p [TARGET], not the reverse.
```

Common error: Reducing target TO known problem instead of known TO target.

#### Pattern 3: Check Both Directions

For reduction correctness proofs:

```text
Verify Q[X] proves both directions:
- (⇒) If original has solution, reduced instance has solution
- (⇐) If reduced instance has solution, original has solution

Check the backward direction especially—it's often weaker.
```

#### Pattern 4: Approximation Ratio Verification

For approximation algorithms:

```text
In Q[X], verify:
1. Approximation ratio defined correctly (ALG/OPT vs OPT/ALG)
2. Both upper and lower bounds provided
3. Construction shows ratio is tight (Θ notation)
```

#### Pattern 5: Contraction Elimination

Academic writing should avoid contractions in formal proofs:

```text
Search document for contractions that weaken formality:
- "We'll" → "We will" or "We show"
- "don't" → "do not"
- "can't" → "cannot"
- "won't" → "will not"
- "isn't/aren't" → "is not/are not"

Fix all instances to maintain formal academic tone.
```

**Why this matters:** Contractions make proofs sound informal or conversational rather than rigorous academic work.

#### Pattern 6: Mathematical Notation Consistency

Ensure consistent use of complexity notation and symbols:

```text
Verify mathematical notation consistency:
1. Complexity bounds: Use Θ(·), O(·), Ω(·) consistently (not mix of Greek/Latin)
2. Set operations: ∈, ⊆, ∪, ∩ used correctly throughout
3. Logic symbols: ∀, ∃, ∧, ∨, ⇒, ⇐ match course conventions
4. Reduction notation: ≤_p written consistently (not mixing formats)
5. Variable naming: Same concepts use same symbols across questions
```

**Why this matters:** Inconsistent notation suggests multiple authors or careless work, reducing credibility.

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

#### Technique 1: Contextual Auditing

Instead of generic "check for errors," provide context:

```text
Q[X] uses a pricing scheme for approximation. According to Week [Y] lectures,
pricing schemes work by [method]. Verify our proof follows this methodology
and the averaging argument is sound.
```

#### Technique 2: Specify Expected Fixes

Tell AI what you expect to find:

```text
I suspect Q[X] has issues with:
- Clause gadget indices (check which variable elements are used)
- Backward direction partition logic (verify the case analysis)

Audit specifically for these and fix as needed.
```

#### Technique 3: Compilation-Driven Debugging

If document formatting breaks:

```text
Line [X] in Q[Y] exceeds the tcolorbox by [N] characters.
Split the formula across multiple lines while maintaining mathematical correctness.
```

#### Technique 4: Lecture-Specific Validation

Reference specific lecture content:

```text
Week [X] lectures define NP-completeness as:
1. Show ∈ NP via verifier
2. Reduce known NP-complete TO target

Verify ALL NP-completeness proofs follow this exact structure.
```

### Quality Control Checklist

#### Before Requesting Improvements

- [ ] Read through entire document yourself
- [ ] Note ALL issues (don't fix one at a time)
- [ ] Check lecture alignment for each question
- [ ] Verify mathematical correctness personally
- [ ] Look for AI markers in final output

#### When Requesting Fixes

- [ ] Be specific about what's wrong
- [ ] Provide line numbers or section references
- [ ] Reference lecture content when relevant
- [ ] Request verification after fixes
- [ ] Ask for compilation check

#### Before Final Submission

- [ ] Compile document (check for errors)
- [ ] Verify all marks present (should sum to total)
- [ ] Search for AI markers (grep for common phrases)
- [ ] Search for contractions (scan for apostrophes in formal proofs)
- [ ] Check mathematical notation consistency
- [ ] Check no incomplete work (TODO, FIXME, ???)
- [ ] Verify professional presentation

### Comprehensive Audit Methodology

When you request "one last audit" or final verification, structure it systematically:

#### Step 1: Determine Audit Scope

Don't just ask "check for errors." Define what needs auditing:

```text
Perform comprehensive final audit covering:
1. AI markers and thinking patterns
2. Technical correctness (reductions, approximations, proofs)
3. Proof completeness (both directions for all bi-directional proofs)
4. Natural voice (contractions, formality, academic tone)
5. Mathematical notation consistency
6. Formatting and presentation quality
```

#### Step 2: Execute Systematic Scans

Use targeted searches to catch specific issues:

**AI Marker Scan:**

```text
Search for: "Wait—", "Hmm,", "The key insight", "Let me",
            "I think", "It turns out", "Observe that"
Report: Number of matches found and locations
```

**Contraction Scan:**

```text
Search for: "'ll", "'ve", "'t", "'s", "'re"
Report: All contractions in formal proof sections
```

**Notation Consistency Scan:**

```text
Check: All complexity bounds use same format (Θ vs Theta)
       All set notation consistent (∈ vs element-of)
       All reduction notation uniform (≤_p format)
```

**Proof Completeness Scan:**

```text
For each reduction/equivalence proof:
- Verify (⇒) direction present and complete
- Verify (⇐) direction present and complete
- Check both directions properly justified
```

#### Step 3: Compilation Verification

After any fixes, always verify document still compiles:

```text
After making fixes:
1. Compile document
2. Check for new errors introduced
3. Verify page count unchanged (or expected)
4. Confirm no formatting breaks
```

#### Step 4: Technical Verification

Cross-reference against course material:

```text
For each question:
- Reduction directions correct (A ≤_p B = B at least as hard as A)
- Approximation ratios correct (ALG/OPT for min, OPT/ALG for max)
- Proof techniques match lecture methodology
- Terminology matches course usage
```

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

#### Pitfall 1: Accepting First Draft

**Problem:** First draft often has 3-5 technical errors
**Solution:** Plan for 2-3 rounds of focused audits per question

#### Pitfall 2: Generic Audit Requests

**Problem:** "Check for errors" finds nothing
**Solution:** "Audit Q3 pricing scheme against Week 9 lecture method"

#### Pitfall 3: Fixing Issues Individually

**Problem:** Makes 10 separate edit requests
**Solution:** List all issues, request fixes in batch

#### Pitfall 4: Skipping Lecture Alignment

**Problem:** Technically correct but methodologically wrong
**Solution:** Always verify against provided lecture notes

#### Pitfall 5: Missing AI Thinking

**Problem:** Submitting work with "Wait—" or "The key insight"
**Solution:** ALWAYS do final search for AI markers before submission

#### Pitfall 6: Overlooking Contractions

**Problem:** Formal proofs contain "We'll", "don't", "can't"
**Solution:** Scan for apostrophes, replace contractions with full forms

#### Pitfall 7: Inconsistent Notation

**Problem:** Mixed use of Θ vs Theta, different reduction arrow styles
**Solution:** Establish notation conventions early, verify consistency in final pass

### Effective Prompt Patterns

#### For Initial Generation

```text
Complete this problem set achieving 100% marks.
[Paste full assignment + lecture notes + requirements]
```

#### For Focused Audits

```text
Audit Q[N] for [specific issue] according to Week [X] lectures.
Fix any errors found and verify correctness.
```

#### For Comprehensive Checks

```text
Comprehensive audit ensuring all work correct and aligned with
Week [X-Y] lectures. Check each question's methodology.
```

#### For Specific Fixes

```text
In Q[N] line [M], [describe specific issue].
Fix this while maintaining [constraints].
```

#### For Final Verification

```text
Final pre-submission check:
1. Compilation status
2. All marks present
3. No TODO/FIXME/AI markers
4. Professional presentation
Report status for each.
```

### The Reality of AI-Assisted Problem Sets

**Expect imperfection initially.** AI will:

- Make 3-5 technical errors per problem set (normal)
- Occasionally use wrong reduction directions (catch in audit)
- Sometimes miss edge cases in proofs (fix in focused review)
- Rarely include AI thinking markers (remove in final pass)
- Occasionally use contractions in formal proofs (fix in polish phase)
- Sometimes inconsistent with mathematical notation (standardize in final audit)

**Your role is iterative refinement, not blind acceptance.** Use the multi-phase audit strategy:

1. Generate complete draft
2. Fix technical errors per question
3. Verify comprehensive alignment
4. Polish presentation (eliminate contractions, standardize notation)
5. Systematic final audit (AI markers, contractions, notation consistency)
6. Compilation verification

This approach achieves 100% marks consistently while maintaining academic integrity through your oversight and validation at every step.

Use this template as your foundation, adapt to specific course needs, and achieve consistent excellence across all assignments.
