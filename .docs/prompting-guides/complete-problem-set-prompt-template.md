## Writing Style Requirements

### ✅ DO:
- Write like a specialized [YEAR]-year computer science undergraduate
- Use natural academic transitions ("We show that...", "Consider the case...", "By construction...")
- Present proofs with clear structure (theorem statements, proof environments, QED)
- Include rigorous mathematical justification for every claim
- Use proper mathematical notation consistently
- Break complex arguments into clear cases (Case 1, Case 2, etc.)
- Provide intuition before formal proofs where appropriate
- Reference specific lecture content and techniques

### ❌ AVOID:
- AI markers: "Moreover", "Furthermore", "Additionally" (unless naturally appropriate)
- Overly formulaic transitions: "It is important to note that..."
- Phrases like "Let's explore", "It's worth noting", "Interestingly"
- Excessive hedging: "arguably", "potentially", "essentially"
- Redundant emphasis: "clearly", "obviously", "evidently" (unless pedagogically necessary)
- Corporate/marketing tone: "leverage", "utilize", "robust solution"

## Solution Structure

### For Each Question:

1. **Read and understand** the problem completely
2. **Identify the core concept** from lecture notes (reduction, approximation, NP-completeness, etc.)
3. **Plan the solution structure** before writing:
   - What theorem/algorithm are we proving/designing?
   - What lecture techniques apply?
   - What are the key steps?
4. **Write the solution** with:
   - Clear statement of what's being proven/designed
   - Rigorous mathematical proofs with all steps justified
   - Proper notation (define all variables)
   - Case analysis where needed
   - Complexity analysis (time/space)
5. **Audit against lecture notes** to ensure:
   - Terminology matches course usage
   - Proof techniques follow course methodology
   - All claims are properly justified per course standards

## Systematic Workflow

### Phase 2: Solution Development
For each question:
1. Write complete solution following course methodology
2. Include all required components (proofs, algorithms, analysis)
3. Add clear explanations and justifications
4. Ensure mathematical rigor at every step

### Phase 3: Technical Audit
1. **Correctness:** Verify all mathematical claims are sound
2. **Completeness:** Check all parts of each question are addressed

5. **Edge cases:** Verify all cases are handled

### Phase 4: Presentation Audit
1. **Voice:** Natural undergraduate academic writing
2. **Structure:** Clear theorem statements, proof environments
3. **Clarity:** No ambiguous statements, all variables defined
4. **Professional:** Proper LaTeX formatting, no typos
5. **AI markers:** Remove any formulaic or robotic phrasing

### Phase 5: Final Verification
1. Compile document and verify page count
2. Check all marks add up correctly
3. Verify no TODO/FIXME markers remain
4. Confirm all questions answered completely
5. Final readthrough for any remaining issues

- Prove both directions: instance has solution ⟺ reduced instance has solution
- Use gadget constructions where appropriate

### For Approximation Algorithms:
- Define approximation ratio clearly (maximization vs minimization)
- Use proper bounds (ALG/OPT for minimization, OPT/ALG for maximization)
- Employ course-specific techniques (pricing schemes, LP relaxation, etc.)
