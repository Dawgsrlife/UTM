Subject: CSC263H5 TA Application

Dear Professor Dixon,

I've attached my completed responses for the CSC263H5 TA application. I apologize for the late submission. I scheduled this email to send Saturday morning, but the scheduled send didn't go through and I only caught it this evening.

I understand if this disqualifies my application, but I wanted to submit my work anyway since I'm genuinely interested in the position. I really enjoyed working through the questions, especially the analysis problems.

I've attended your ICPC meetings and I'm currently in your CSC373H5 course. If you're still considering applications, I'd love the opportunity to TA for CSC263H5.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Alex
