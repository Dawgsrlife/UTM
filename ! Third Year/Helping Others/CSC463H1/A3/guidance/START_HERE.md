### Points at Risk:

| Question  | Issue                                                | Points Lost | Fix Location      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Q3        | Wrong approach (trying to reduce arbitrary NP langs) | **-8**      | ULTIMATE_GUIDE §6 |
| Q4        | Missing co-NP proof                                  | **-5**      | ULTIMATE_GUIDE §7 |
| Q1        | Imprecise language                                   | -2          | ULTIMATE_GUIDE §4 |

**Current trajectory: ~60% (24/40)**  
**After fixes: 95-100% (38-40/40)**

## ⚡ Fast Track (If You Only Have 2 Hours)

### Hour 1: Q3 Complete Rewrite

- Go to ULTIMATE_GUIDE.md Section 6
- Follow the template EXACTLY
- Key: Use P = NP to get a DECIDER, use that in reduction
- **Saves 8 points**

### Hour 2: Q4 co-NP Proof

- Go to ULTIMATE_GUIDE.md Section 7
- Write all three cases (m=1, m prime, m composite)
- Cite AKS primality test
- **Saves 5 points**

**Result: 87-90% (35-36/40) with just these two fixes**

---

## 📅 Full Track (If You Have 3-4 Hours)

Follow the time budget in ULTIMATE_GUIDE.md:

- **Hour 1:** Q3 rewrite (8 pts saved)
- **Hour 2:** Q4 co-NP + Q1 polish (7 pts saved)
- **Hour 3:** Q2 details + review (1 pt saved)

**Result: 95-100% (38-40/40)**

---

## 🎯 Priority Order

**DO THESE IN ORDER:**

1. **Q3 FIX** (45 min) - Highest impact
2. **Q4 co-NP** (30 min) - Second highest
3. **Q1 polish** (20 min) - Easy wins
4. **Q2 details** (15 min) - Finishing touches
5. **Review** (30 min) - Final check

## ⚠️ Critical Don'ts

### Q3: DON'T

❌ Try to reduce SAT to CLIQUE or any arbitrary NP languages  
❌ Use certificates or verifiers  
❌ Think "all NP languages reduce to each other"

### Q3: DO

✅ Use P = NP to get a DECIDER M_L  
✅ Run M_L on input x  
✅ Map result to fixed strings y_yes or y_no

### Q4: DON'T

❌ Try to list all non-divisors  
❌ Forget to cite AKS  
❌ Give exponential-sized certificates

### Q4: DO

✅ Use three cases: m=1, m prime, m composite  
✅ Cite AKS primality test (2002)  
✅ Prove certificate size is O(log² m)

- [ ] Q4 has all three co-NP cases written
- [ ] Q1 says "no infinite subset" clearly
- [ ] Q2 has full algorithm + O(n³) analysis
- [ ] Every proof has structure: assume → show → conclude
- [ ] You can explain Q3 without saying "reduce NP languages to each other"
